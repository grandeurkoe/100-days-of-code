# 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp
Built 1 real-world Python project every day for the next 100 days. <br/><br/>
Projects are of increasing difficulty as we iteratively move from day 1 to day 100. These projects are built in correspondence with 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp course. This course was taught by London's App Brewery top instructor Angela Yang.<br/><br/>
Each project has been built from scratch with mininum to no assistance.
